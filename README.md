# Upgrade Belt iOS

Upgrade Belt project is created in order to help Taekwon-Do students to learn the terminology, the patterns and the history of Taekwon-Do in preparation to grading.

Using the app students can: 
* browse grading material by belt syllabus, 
* watch videos of how to perform patterns,
* take terminology quiz (in future releases).

Check out more information about Taekwon-Do at http://www.rita-itf.org
